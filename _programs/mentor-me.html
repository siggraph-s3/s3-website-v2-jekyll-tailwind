<p>MentorMe aims to match students and emerging professionals with less than 3 yearsâ€™ experience with industry professionals that have agreed to give their time to offer guidance and insight into their chosen field. The mentor sessions are facilitated through email, phone meetings, and in some cases in-person, which is typically during the SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Asia conferences when the community comes together. S3 hopes that these mentorships can turn into long lasting professional connections for our members. Sign-ups will be advertised on our website and via the S3 Facebook page.</p>
<p>Mentors and mentees will be paired during a 6 week long cohort to conduct career path or professional discussions. All meeting requests are coordinated directly between mentors and mentees. We hope that mentors and mentees can meet at least once per week for approximately 1 hour total per week.</p>
